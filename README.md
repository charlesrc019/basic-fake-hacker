# 💻 **HackerSim 1.0**

## Project Overview
Welcome to *HackerSim 1.0* – a revolutionary hacking simulator created by a 10-year-old tech wizard! This project simulates the experience of “hacking” like the pros in the movies. This program doesn’t actually hack anything (we’re just pretending here), but it sure makes you feel like a tech genius!

## Features
- **Realistic Terminal Look:** A classic black screen with green or white text, for that authentic hacker vibe.
- **Scrolling Code Effect:** Watch as the “code” scrolls past in real-time – it’s just for show, but it looks awesome.
- **Randomized Commands & Codes:** Each run generates different “commands” and “passwords” so every hack attempt feels unique.
- **Access Granted Message:** When the "hack" is “successful,” you get the classic "Access Granted" message – like you've just cracked the mainframe!

## Installation
1. Download *HackerSim 1.0* to your computer.
2. Double-click to open – no fancy installs required.
3. Adjust your screen to make the text fill up for maximum effect.

## How to Use
1. Open the program.
2. Sit back, let the "code" flow, and enjoy feeling like a pro hacker!
3. Show it to your friends and watch them be amazed.

## Disclaimer
*HackerSim 1.0* is just for fun and doesn’t actually perform any real hacking. This project is a product of curiosity and imagination from a 10-year-old who loves technology and coding. Please enjoy responsibly!
